##  LATEX template

Sample files that illustrate the creation and use of classes, packages, and large documents in LATEX.  Please refer the [example file](https://github.com/Cesar-Urteaga/1706_LATEX_TEMPLATE/blob/master/_TEXTS/Main.pdf) to see what the example class and package can do.

##  Organization of the files

The project has the following structure:
  * **_RESOURCES**: Include some relevant files that were used during the construction of the project (e.g., manuals, Web page content, etc.).
  * **_TEXTS**: Contains the TEX files that exemplify the creation and use of the LATEX files described above.
